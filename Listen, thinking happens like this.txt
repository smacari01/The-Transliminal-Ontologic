Listen, thinking happens like this:

Let's say I ask you what "Concept C" means. 
You think, "Break down 'Concept C'. You think further, "The term 'Concept' means A. The term 'C' means B." You, then, continue in thinking, "Now, find relations to A and B to demonstrate AB = Concept C." You then will say, "Concept C is AB. A has D, E, and F. B has G, H, and I. Concept C is AB because D, E, F, G, H, and I."

So, what is "Concept C" to you, in terms of *engagement*? 

"Concept C" is what I call a *phenomenon*. A phenomenon is anything at all in which you have engagement, that it shows up as *some-thing* at all and presents itself with a way to go about it, have investment or involvement in it, that expresses itself in its articulation -- "articulation" meaning "shows up to (me, you, him, her, it, us, them, you all)". More, phenomena are the transcendental manifestations of Being itself -- "Being itself" is simply the expressive impermanence of the absolute emptiness "everywhere" and nowhere, Being itself is *what shows the fundamental impermanence of reality*.  

The phenomenon, especially for you, has what I call an *anchoring*. Anchoring is a term I use to invoke the specific transcendentality of Being through phenomena. There is no "I" (as such no "you", no "he", "she", "it", "we", "they", etc.,) -- meaning, there is no stable self that persists from "moment" to "moment" -- there are, of course, as well no "moments". There is emptiness, nothing "there" at all. And I say "emptiness" but I really am saying "saturated emptiness". There is Being, however. There is Being because emptiness is not a pure void. The fundamental emptiness of reality, saturated emptiness, is the completely saturated density of potentiality to be. In order for there "to be" anything, and for there to be the continuation "to be" there cannot be stable, fixed, "ended" things -- what space could such "ended" beings allow for beings to be? Beings would have nothing to be if they were already completely delimited full-round, fully defined as they are, end. There needs to be emptiness to allow for the emergence of the potential to be and, therefore, being. Being, as such, becomes really no more than the expression of the emergence of the potential fully alongside that same emergence's falling away (to further enable the emergence of being). That is to say, Being is expressive impermanence. There needs to be something else in the mix, then, though for being to be. If "everything" is no-thing-at-all, then how is there any-thing at all? There must be a structural situation that "denies" the emptiness of fundamental reality.

The structural situation that "denies" saturated emptiness is the Ego -- at least one of the structural situations, whether there are others I have not gone far enough to say. 
The Ego is "denial" as a structural situation. It is a "situation" because it is the "locus" or "point" at which impermanence expressed (Being) finds itself involved in/encountering/engaging emptiness itself (saturated emptiness). I place the terms "locus" or "point" in quotation marks because there is not actually a "point" there -- there can't be since there is simply impermanent expression of potentiality which is no-thing. But it is a useful metaphor. Why? Because it goes to show the experience of the "conscious ego", the experience of the ego consciously experiencing. What shows up in the ego's conscious experiences? Phenomena, things to be involved in.

One might ask, here, "But there are no phenomena. Phenomena are gone *alongside* their own emergence, no?" Right! I would then say. "So then how and why and...huh?". -- Let me break it down further and settle the point I was making about anchoring: 

Phenomena are there *For-us*. Phenomena persist. But if phenomena have their own way to be, then they express being. Meaning, they express impermanence. How does a thing both express  permanence and persist at once? The answer is that phenomena are the transcendental manifestation of Being itself. Being has its way to be, i.e., express impermanence. Being expresses impermanence not by being some "One" ontic "Thing". No. If Being is to express impermanence then * "it" must be a myriad* of expressions, overlapping, overlaying, consuming, subsuming, undermining, overriding, overthrowing, overstepping, hiding, concealing, revealing, disclosing, foreclosing, foreshadowing, expressing, resting, rising, falling, living, birthing, breathing, dying, so on and so forth. Right? 

Okay -- so Being being *many* in order to be expressive impermanence, so that being can be at all (all of which sounds incredibly and profoundly circular), also has a way to be that is being *itself*. That is to say, the *show* of impermanence (one might choose "the depiction", "the demonstration", "the expression", "the revelation", "the exposition", "the disclosure", so on and so forth). The way in which Being "shows" its own Being means, therefore, that the myriad are shown against the backdrop of impermanence. "But doesn't that really just mean that the impermanent expressions are "shown" against impermanence "showing"?" -- And yes! That is absolutely correct. There is a way of Being, that is Being being itself, in which impermanence is impermanent to its own impermanence. 

For impermanence to be impermanent before "its"-"self" (both in quotation because how, truly, *how* could there be an it or a self here?) impermanence must *hold*. This "holding" is the transcendental nature of Being, where Being "steps over and goes beyond itself" (think German "Übergang" or "übersteigen"). This stepping over and going beyond itself is phenomena. In my studies and writings I call this the "elastic ekstatic mutidimensionality" of being. Heidegger calls it "ekstasis". I believe it might be the "abschatungen" for Husserl. And is potentially the "Übergehen" of Nietzsche. Continental Western philosophy is ripe with these descriptions. I have interpreted this transcendentality through an extension of Heidegger's existential ontological analytic of Dasein through an revised Nietzschean genealogy and the (jnana) yoga of Advaita Vedanta and Buddhist thought as well as through observational studies of my own, lived, experiences. 

I have arrived at the point where I understand this transcendentality to be the experience of temporality that gets called, in the realm of the ego, "time" or "clock time" or "regular time". 
Future Projections (Assumptions, Approaches, Determinative Factors given by potential, etc) are the Transliminal Point Where saturated emptiness is Centered in the Ego. The Past (Past Experiences Recollected, Memories, Presuppositions, Approaches, Determinative Factors based on what has happened) is Phenomena Continuing to Orient the Centering of Ego. And the Present (Now, Experiencing, Situation, Circumstances, Embodiment) is the General Transliminality of Ego or  The Transliminality of the Intersection Between Phenomenal Being and saturated emptiness Where Phenomena Cling To One Another And Forge Pathways of Meaning. 

All of this is to say, the way that Being has its own being to be is in phenomena *clinging* and *attaching* to one another, extending themselves *beyond* "their" "place to be" in the way they have their own being (their own unique way of being impermanence in the reification of absolute impermanent emptiness pregnant with potentiality). Phenomena cling to one another, and that is the anchoring of phenomena. Phenomena cling to one another, and form anchoring chains of phenomenal being. We say that things and events become increasingly more *not-present* as "time goes on" and that is precisely because phenomena have gone out "long, long ago" -- as in they were literally never there to begin with. I have explained this at length elsewhere in greater detail -- if you need that to better understand I can supply but hopefully this is sufficient. 

At any rate, the way in which Being extends beyond itself, as phenomena, creates anchors that "hold" together in a myriad, or perhaps better now to say, *manifold* of phenomenal attachments. All phenomena are contingent/conditioned. All phenomena require every other to have anything to be at all. 

In my work I have explained this, as a small sample, in this way: "The meaning of the being of temporality is the gathering of being around the way to be. The Question—the way to be that looks purely for responding to. The Question, that is, is the call as in its essence. The Question, furthermore, responds to itself through the way it calls.
For example, when I ask, “Where are my shoes?” I don’t go looking to the sky, the ceiling, the refrigerator, the store I’ve never been to, etc. When I ask, “Where are my shoes?” I go looking towards the floor. In posing the question, "Where are my shoes?", I am not merely uttering words but initiating a call that structures my engagement with the world. The question functions as an enclosure, a hermeneutical circle that both calls for a response and raises a matter of concern within itself. This call is genealogically related to the phenomena it seeks; it organizes my attention and directs my movement through the relational space of my environment.
The question is not just a linguistic construct but an ontological opening—a modality through which phenomena are disclosed. It attunes me to the relevant aspects of my world, centering certain phenomena while decentering others. The floor, for instance, steps forward into prominence, not merely as a physical location but as a meaningful horizon where my shoes are likely to be found.
This everyday example illuminates a deeper ontological structure. What appears as simple spatial navigation actually reveals how phenomena organize themselves through what we might call circles of focus. When we engage with any phenomenon—in this case, shoes—we do so within multiple contextual circles simultaneously. Each circle represents a domain of meaningful relationships that can be centered or decentered in our attention.
These circles of focus illustrate the multidimensional nature of the transliminal being. We are not only what we think, feel, do, or perceive; rather, we exist ekstatically within and as all these aspects simultaneously. This ekstatic multidimensionality allows us to transcend the immediate context of our engagement and to relate phenomena across different domains of meaning.
Our existence is not confined to a linear progression of moments but is characterized by an elastic transcendence that stretches beyond the present, encompassing past experiences and future possibilities. The shoes, in this sense, are not merely objects in space but thresholds—phenomena that stand at the liminal point between various dimensions of our being. They embody the potential to transition between states, to open the way toward different modes of engagement.
Expanding the Circles of Focus
Consider how this operates at different levels of engagement:
First, there is the immediate circle of spatial relationships—the floor, the doorway, the specific places where shoes typically rest. This is not mere physical location but rather a network of meaningful connections that emerge through regular patterns of use and engagement.
Second, there is the broader circle of functional relationships—the transition between outside and inside, the practices of removing shoes, the customs of shoe placement. These relationships aren't arbitrary but emerge from how the phenomenon of "shoes" participates in our way of dwelling.
Third, there is what we might call the circle of existential significance—how shoes participate in our broader patterns of being-in-the-world, marking transitions between different modes of engagement (formal/informal, public/private, work/home).
In this way, the transliminal being reveals itself as the being whose way of being is to engage with what it encounters by becoming what it engages. Our existence is ontological in that we are always already being-with, being-in, and being-as the phenomena that we encounter. The act of searching for our shoes is not merely a practical task but an expression of our fundamental mode of being—an ontological inquiry into the meaning of our existence as it unfolds within the world.
The process of centering and decentering phenomena reflects the transliminal being's capacity for ekstatic elasticity. We transcend our immediate situation by projecting ourselves into potential ways to be, guided by the calls of the phenomena that step forth. Each phenomenon we engage with participates in a hermeneutical circle, where meaning is both derived from and contributes to our understanding of the whole.
When we ask "Where are my shoes?", we activate all these circles simultaneously, though not all come into explicit focus. The floor emerges as significant not through simple spatial proximity but because it participates in the entire network of meaningful relationships that constitute our engagement with shoes. This is why the ceiling, despite being just as physically close, does not enter into consideration—it does not participate in the relevant circles of meaning.
This example thus illustrates how phenomena are not merely present-at-hand objects in space but rather nodes in complex networks of meaning that emerge through our engaged dwelling. The shoes' "place" is not simply a spatial location but a nexus point where multiple circles of significance intersect. Through this intersection, the phenomenon reveals not just its physical presence but its participation in the broader structures of meaningful experience.
Attunement and Situationality
I go looking towards a specific style of floor—not the floor of the tub, not the floor in front of the cat litter box, not the floor of the attic. I look towards the floor around about “where shoes go.” Furthermore, this “where shoes go” is towards where I look because they are where they belong. Further still, I look towards the floor around about where shoes belong because where they belong is where I have put them time and again.
I have put shoes where they belong time and again because the sky, for example, does not open the way for me to take my shoes off and put them down somewhere. The ceiling, likewise, does not open the way for me to take my shoes off and put them down somewhere—the refrigerator does not either, for that matter. An unknown store does not show me the way to where my shoes can and do go. Neither does the bathtub floor nor the floor before the cat litter box show me precisely where to put my shoes. Not even does the floor of the attic, really, go to mean, “This is where the place shoes are to be.”
This lack of attunement with the unknown store illustrates the transliminal being's engagement with phenomena through situationality and potentiality-to-be. The store, being outside the horizon of familiar potentialities, does not open the way for my shoes' belonging. The transliminal being elastically bends toward phenomena that are situationally relevant, those that have established relationships within its existential framework. This bending is an expression of being-with-in-and-as, where the self engages with phenomena that it both is and is not, grounded in its ownmost possibilities."

So, what I mean is -- all that has being, all that shows up, i.e., phenomena, are contingent and conditioned by one another...including consciousness which is a misinterpretation of the relationship between Being, its transcendental nature when it encounters itself, and saturated emptiness, the emptiness potentiality that groundlessly grounds Being's to be.

Returning all the way back now and (hopefully) concluding, for now:

"Concept C" is a phenomenon. It presents itself to you as something that *can* be decomposed and broken up to be *thought* about precisely because it is contingent and conditioned. It is a way of Being that is extended beyond itself, being not there at all, attached and clinging to a manifold that "it itself" supports the generation of.
That it is conditioned, and because it is an expression of impermanence, it steps-forward and in stepping-forward simultaneously opens-the-way to the open (empty) potentiality of all to which it has a direct relationality with, i.e., that to which it does and can cling and attach to. 
It is an anchor that hangs on and holds together by and with a manifold of other possibilities of being. But you will never find a way to define a phenomenon for itself unconditioned by anything except "its" "self". The only "thing" that is not "conditioned", which is unconditioned, is emptiness, saturated emptiness -- saturated emptiness depends upon nothing else to be, it simply "is" by way of being *no thing at all*. 

Thinking does not think about emptiness. The Ego does not accept emptiness readily. No. Thinking thinks in ways that reify emptiness by serving as a way of emptiness, as the way of Being being itself, which is impermanence impermanent in its own impermanence, which is the structural situation of the denial, rejection, and ignorance of the fundamental reality of no-thing-at-all, saturated emptiness.
