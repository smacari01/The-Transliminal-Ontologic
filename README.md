# The Transliminal Ontologic: A Framework Beyond Subject and Object

This repository contains philosophical works developing "transliminal ontologic" - a fundamental reconceptualization of consciousness, being, and temporality that moves beyond traditional subject-object frameworks.

## Core Concepts

### The Transliminal Being
Neither subject nor substance but a structural field of engagement characterized by elastic ekstatic multidimensionality. The transliminal being is that which exists, and does so not within boundaries but rather within and as matrices as the threshold passage of their own nature, preceding and making possible the conventional distinction between subject and object.

### Meaning-Density
The gathering and textural variation of significance that constitutes the fundamental being of experience. Different patterns of meaning-gathering create different temporal experiences and express the manifestation of phenomena.

### The Aging Matrix
The temporal structure of reflexive stabilization through which all phenomena manifest in their passing-away. Our orientation toward the "indefinitely definite end" (death as certain yet indeterminate) creates a unique temporal matrix where phenomena present themselves as always already in the process of passing away in the same framework of their stepping forward and opening the way to--.

### Remnancy
The phenomenal persistence of past engagements that actively structure present possibilities. Unlike conventional accounts of memory as stored representations, remnancy describes how the past literally lives in the present as the structure of available possibilities.

## Methodological Approach

This framework emerges from a methodology that synthesizes phenomenological attention with genealogical investigation, attending both to immediate lived experience and to the historical forces that have shaped how Being presents itself.

## Status of Work

These materials represent ongoing philosophical and scientific development. While certain elements continue to be refined, the fundamental framework and key concepts are established as presented here.
